the main problem concerns #developpers_health, because developpers #pass_the_whole_day_coding and standing at their offices, so we got the idea to develop a web application that will #give_advices_to_users...
##Work_method
the application works in background and tries to take pictures sometimes to the developper in order to analyse them and send a popup notification in the browser
also the application has a second way to work, it can be executed as a main activity, provides the possibility to upload a picture and analyse it, and also offer the possibility to analyse a text and tries to decrypt the user's emotions
